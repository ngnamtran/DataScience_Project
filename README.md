# DataScience_Project

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to analyze the student performance in exams by using linear regression and distribution, and predicting how students perform for each object. This project will be helpful for teachers in highschool to keep track of their students, subjects that the student performs in class. Therefore, the teacher can have further action for each student.

## Selection of Dataset
The model processing and training are using a Jupyter Notebook with python language  and is available in the “code” folder of this repository.The data has 1000 high school students in the United States with 8 characteristics including: 
-  gender (female, male), 
-  race/ethnicity(group A, group B, group C, group D, group E)
-  parent level education (some highschool, highschool, some college, associate’s degree, bachelor’s degree, master’s degree)
-  lunch (standard, free/reduced)
-  test preparation course ( none, completed) 
-  math score [0,100]
-  reading core [17,100]
-  writing score [10,100]
The dataset can be found on [Royce Kimmons website](http://roycekimmons.com/tools/generated_data/exams). Otherwise, you can find on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams/data).
